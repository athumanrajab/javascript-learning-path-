// Activating strict mode in javascript helps to avoid some common mistakes and bugs in the code. It prevents the use of undeclared variables and other unsafe actions such as using of reserved keywords such as interface, if, etc.
"use strict";

if (passTest) hasDriverLicense = true; // This line will throw an error on the console with the help of strict mode because "hasDriverLicense" is not declared. The correct variable name is "hasDriversLicense".
if (hasDriversLicense) console.log("I can drive");

const interface = "Audio"; // This line will throw an error on the console with the help of strict mode because "interface" is a reserved keyword in javascript.
